# AMD BIOS Settings List

This list is for AMD BIOS settings and has been tested on both AM4 and AM5 platforms. In order to adjust these settings, you will need to download Scewin, a software that gives you access to all the BIOS' hidden settings. Join [Discord.gg/tweaking](https://discord.gg/tweaking) to get the download or if you have any questions.

## Important Notes:
- Apply the settings in groups of 4 max. Applying too many settings at once can cause issues. 
- Applying in groups of 4 helps identify the setting that didn't work if issues occur.
- If something goes wrong, you can perform a CMOS reset to restore the BIOS to default settings.
- I am not responsible for any damages that may occur while using this list.
-  I did not make scewin, I simply added it on into the downloads to make it easier to download

## Instructions:
1. Download Scewin software.
2.Extract scewin and run export as administrator
3.A cmd textbox should appear and say script file exported successfully and a txt should appear called nvram

4.Open nvram and use the search feature to look for settings, use the bios list to see what to change, there are multiple of the same settings so make sure you search up and down to change all of them otherwise it won't work
5. After that save the file and then run import as administrator and it should say script file imported successfully, warnings are normal

7. Apply settings in groups of 4 for optimal results.
8. If issues occur, perform a CMOS reset to restore default BIOS settings. 
9. Join Discord.gg/tweaking for assistance or questions.

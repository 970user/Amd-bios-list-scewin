This list is for amd bios' it has been tested on am4 and am5 platform
In order to do all the settings you will need to download scewin which is a software that gives you access to all the bios' hidden settings, join discord.gg/tweaking to get the download or if you have any questions
Apply the settings in groups of 4 max otherwise issues can occur if you apply in one go plus, you can identify the setting that didn't work for you if you apply in groups of 4
If something goes wrong you can do a cmos reset which will reset the bios
I am not responsible for any damages that may occur while using this list

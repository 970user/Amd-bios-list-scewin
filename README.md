# AMD BIOS Settings List

This list is for AMD BIOS settings and has been tested on both AM4 and AM5 platforms. In order to adjust these settings, you will need to download Scewin, a software that gives you access to all the BIOS' hidden settings. Join [Discord.gg/tweaking](https://discord.gg/tweaking) to get the download or if you have any questions.

## Important Notes:
- Apply the settings in groups of 4 max. Applying too many settings at once can cause issues. 
- Applying in groups of 4 helps identify the setting that didn't work if issues occur.
- If something goes wrong, you can perform a CMOS reset to restore the BIOS to default settings.
- I am not responsible for any damages that may occur while using this list.

## Instructions:
1. Download Scewin software.
2. Join Discord.gg/tweaking for assistance or questions.
3. Apply settings in groups of 4 for optimal results.
4. If issues occur, perform a CMOS reset to restore default BIOS settings.
